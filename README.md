# RingCentral-Call-Log-Exporter
This program takes the 6 RingCentral Call Logs that we save into a google drive folder and converts them to be google sheets. From there it combines all the new sheets into one. Then it inserts a new sheet and formula that queries the data. Lastly, we add the queried data to our Sales Report Spreadsheet.
